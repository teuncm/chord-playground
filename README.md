# Chord Playground

### [Live demo](https://teuncm.github.io/chord-playground/)

Interactive playground to explore the feeling of musical chords, scales, inversion and key changes.

### Functionality

- Action selector: apply a chord action across the entire note pad
- Chord selector: select notes of chord and chord root
- Shift selector: select shift applied to chord
- Note pad: clicking on the pad creates a chord anchored to the chord root
- Tuning selector: change the tuning of the synthesizer by a maximum of 50 cents

### To do

- [x] Make circle button note triggers always span one octave only
- [x] Make arp up/down note triggers always in midi order, starting from the correct octave
- [ ] Make individual note triggers take into account last pressed action button for extra effects
- [ ] Shift individual note triggers by actual textual value
- [ ] Make synth sound nicer :)
